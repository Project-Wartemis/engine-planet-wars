# Planet Wars Engine for Wartemis

This is a TypeScript implementation for the game called `Planet Wars`.
The mechanics of the game were taken from [MOZAIC](https://github.com/ZeusWPI/MOZAIC) which held a one-time competition in 2018,
which was inspired on the [2010 Fall competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Challenge) organized by Google and the University of Waterloo.

### Dependencies

This engine uses the wartemis npm package.
